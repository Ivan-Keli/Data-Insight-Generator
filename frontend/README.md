   - Clean separation of concerns

2. **LLM Integration**
   - Abstracted LLM service interface with provider-specific implementations
   - Prompt engineering utilities for context-aware queries
   - Error handling with fallback mechanisms

3. **Data Processing**
   - Pandas integration for dataset analysis
   - Statistical profiling for datasets
   - Smart handling of different file types and encodings

4. **Code Organization**
   - Modular service architecture
   - Clear model definitions with Pydantic
   - Utility functions for common operations

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built with Next.js and TailwindCSS:

1. **Component Structure**
   - Clean hierarchy of components
   - Separation of UI, feature, and data components
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

2. **State Management**
   - React hooks for local state management
   - Context for session management
   - Clean API service layer

3. **UI/UX Design**
   - Modern, clean interface with TailwindCSS
   - Appropriate loading states and error handling
   - Intuitive data visualization
   - Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

4. **User Experience Features**
   - Example queries for better usability
   - Clear visual feedback for operations
   - Smooth transitions and loading states

## Exceeded Requirements

1. **Enhanced Data Analysis**
   - Added detailed dataset statistics
   - Data quality visualization
   - Column-specific analysis

2. **Advanced LLM Integration**
   - Multiple LLM provider support
   - Query type-specific prompt engineering
   - Fallback mechanisms for reliability

3. **Improved User Experience**
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Expandable dataset statistics
   - Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
   - Copy-to-clipboard functionality

4. **Technical Excellence**
   - Clean code architecture
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Performance optimization with caching
   - Clear documentation

## Next Steps

If this were a production application, the following enhancements could be considered:

1. **Authentication & User Management**
   - User accounts with saved datasets and queries
   - Team collaboration features

2. **Advanced Data Processing**
   - Support for more file formats (Parquet, SQL, etc.)
   - Larger file handling with streaming processing
   - Data transformation capabilities

3. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Interactive charts based on dataset characteristics
   - Exportable visualizations and reports

4. **LLM Integration Improvements**
   - Fine-tuning for specific data analysis tasks
   - Support for more LLM providers
